**Conclusion**
To navigate between components or pages we can use react-router-dom.  
"Link" is used to make an element as clickable link.  
"NavLink" is use when we want to add custom styles to the link such as className attribute.  
We can use "useNavigate()" from react-router-dom to navigate from one path to another when a special event occured. Such as when a successful login we can navigate to dashboard.
